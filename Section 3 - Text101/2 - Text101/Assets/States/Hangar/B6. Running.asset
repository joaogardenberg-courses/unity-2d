  storyText: "You run down a long corridor then up a flight of metal stairs. They\r
    make a loud racket as you clamber up them. Thank goodness the machinery in this\r
    place is so loud.\n\nIn front of you is the emergency exit door. It has an\r
    oversized, cast iron lock hanging from a bolted handle. You could try picking\r
    the lock, or maybe look for a way to pry it off.\n\nWhat to do?\n1.\r Pick it.\n2.
    Pry it."
