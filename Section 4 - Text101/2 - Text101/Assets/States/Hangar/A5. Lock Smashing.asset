  storyText: "Got to be something around here to help with some smashy smashy. You\r
    see a crate with all manner of pipes, wires and cogs scattered within it. Mostly\r
    trash.\n\nYou could try the brute force approach - wack the lock with one\r of
    the pipes. Or you could take some time to build a contraption with some kind\r
    of leverage, maybe a mini pulley system with those wires and the cogs.\n\nHow\r
    to proceed?\n1. No time to waste, grab the pipe, start wacking.\n2. Take the\r
    time to build a leverage-gadget."
