    off\r and the door opened. Thank goodness for the Pumping Station being so loud.\n\nYou're\r

    \"...get\r out in time?\", THUNK THUNK, \"...massive pressure\", THUNK THUNK
    \"...for glory\"...\r THUNK THUNK...\n\nWhat next, Adventurer?\n1. Get closer
    to the people\r speaking.\n2. Ignore them, keep pushing for the airship."
